Now we implemented here multiple exchanges. I just want binance to load data.

Then lets build a dashboard first. I want it be on a browser, just a page. doesn't need to be a website

I should see the crypto,
also it should give information on how many confluences  it has, if there is a signal or close to a signal it should tell me  tp sl etc. 
Implement also that it searches prepelixty.ai. that it reads tweets using grok, and loads all other data for sentiment or anything that might influence the signal. 
The model should learn and keep learning. Use Deepseeks model as it is good in financial markets.The models take everything factor in mind.

We need to build something simple but good and nice design of the UI. 
We should see later other models available so we can see which model says what for trading signal.
We will use different trading techniques so that should be also visible on the browser page

Lets start with implementation per implementation. We need to be efficient.
