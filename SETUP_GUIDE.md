```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't start

   ```bash
   # Change the port in .env file
   DASHBOARD_PORT=8080
   ```

2. **Verify Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

3. **Check API credentials:**
   - Ensure Binance API keys are correct
   - Make sure API keys have proper permissions

### No price data showing

1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Verify Binance API keys are valid**
3. **Check browser console for errors** (F12 â†’ Console tab)

### WebSocket disconnected

- The dashboard will automatically try to reconnect
- Check your network connection
- Ensure the backend server is running

## Next Steps

### Enable AI Analysis

To enable full AI-powered trading analysis:

1. **Add DeepSeek API key** - For deep market analysis
2. **Add Grok API key** - For Twitter sentiment
3. **Add Perplexity API key** - For market research

Once these are configured, the system will:
- Analyze market sentiment from multiple sources
- Generate AI-powered trading signals
- Provide multi-model consensus recommendations
- Track whale movements and on-chain data
- Perform continuous learning

### Modules to Implement Next

The following features are planned and can be integrated:

1. **DeepSeek Integration** - AI-powered financial analysis
2. **Perplexity.ai Integration** - Market research and news analysis
3. **Grok Integration** - Twitter and social media sentiment
4. **Multi-Model Comparison** - Show what each AI model recommends
5. **Continuous Learning** - AI models learn from past signals

## Safety Reminders

- **Start with paper trading** - Test with small amounts first
- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
- **Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile**
- **AI signals are recommendations, not guarantees**
- **Always do your own research**
- **Use proper risk management**

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the TODO.md file for current development status
- Review the README.md for system architecture details
- Check the logs in the terminal for error messages

## Development Mode

To run in development mode with auto-reload:

```bash
# Set DEBUG_MODE=True in .env
DEBUG_MODE=True
```

Then run:
```bash
python run_dashboard.py
```

The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
